# Terminology
This section provides definitions and explanations of key terms and concepts used throughout the Haste Health documentation.
Understanding this terminology is essential for effectively utilizing the platform and its features.

## FHIR Terminology
FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. 
It defines a set of "resources" that represent various healthcare concepts, such as patients, practitioners, medications, and observations.
FHIR terminology services provide a way to manage and utilize standardized medical vocabularies, code systems, and value sets within the FHIR framework.

### Resources
The following FHIR resources are commonly used in terminology services:
- **CodeSystem**: Represents a set of codes drawn from one or more code systems.
- **ValueSet**: A collection of codes from one or more code systems, intended for use in a particular context.
- **ConceptMap**: A mapping between two or more code systems, allowing for translation of codes from one system to another.
- **TerminologyCapabilities**: Describes the capabilities of a FHIR server with respect to terminology services.

### Terminology Operations
FHIR terminology services support various operations, including:
- **$expand**: Expands a ValueSet to include all the codes it contains.
- **$validate-code**: Validates whether a given code is part of a specified ValueSet.
- **$translate**: Translates a code from one code system to another using a ConceptMap.
