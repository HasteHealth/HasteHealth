# Read Resource

The FHIR [read operation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#read) allows you to retrieve a specific resource instance by its ID from the FHIR server. This is done using an HTTP GET request to the endpoint corresponding to the resource type and ID.

## Endpoint

```
GET /w/[tenant]/api/v1/[project]/fhir/r4/[ResourceType]/[id]
```

Where `[ResourceType]` is the type of resource (e.g., Patient, Observation) and `[id]` is the logical ID of the resource instance.

## Response

If the resource is found, the server will respond with a `200 OK` status code and include the resource in the response body.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/fhir+json
```

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "12345",
  "name": [
    {
      "use": "official",
      "family": "Doe",
      "given": ["John"]
    }
  ],
  "gender": "male",
  "birthDate": "1980-01-01"
}
```

## Error Handling

If the resource is not found, the server will respond with a `404 Not Found` status code and include an `OperationOutcome` resource in the response body.

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/fhir+json
```

```json
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": "not-found",
      "diagnostics": "Resource Patient/12345 not found"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example using cURL

Here is an example of how to read a Patient resource using cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/w/[tenant]/api/v1/[project]/fhir/r4/Patient/12345" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/fhir+json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This command sends a GET request to retrieve the Patient resource with ID 12345.
