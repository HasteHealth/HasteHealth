# Create Resource

The FHIR [create operation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#create) allows you to create a new resource of a specified type on the FHIR server. This is done using an HTTP POST request to the endpoint corresponding to the resource type.
## Endpoint

```
POST /w/[tenant]/api/v1/[project]/fhir/r4/[ResourceType]
```

Where `[ResourceType]` is the type of resource you want to create (e.g., Patient, Observation, etc.).
## Request Body
The request body should contain the JSON representation of the resource you want to create. Here is an example of creating a new Patient resource:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "name": [
    {
      "use": "official",
      "family": "Doe",
      "given": ["John"]
    }
  ],
  "gender": "male",
  "birthDate": "1980-01-01"
}
```
## Response
If the resource is created successfully, the server will respond with a `201 Created` status code and include the newly created resource in the response body, along with a `Location` header indicating the URL of the created resource.   


HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /w/[tenant]/api/v1/[project]/fhir/r4/Patient/12345
Content-Type: application/fhir+json
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "12345",
  "name": [
    {
      "use": "official",
      "family": "Doe",
      "given": ["John"]
    }
  ],
  "gender": "male",
  "birthDate": "1980-01-01"
}
```
## Error Handling
If there are any issues with the request (e.g., missing required fields, invalid data), the server will respond with an appropriate error status code (e.g., `400 Bad Request`) and include an `OperationOutcome` resource in the response body detailing the errors.   


HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/fhir+json
```json
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": "invalid",
      "diagnostics": "Missing required field: name"
    }
  ]
}

```
## Example using cURL
Here is an example of how to create a new Patient resource using cURL:  

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/w/[tenant]/api/v1/[project]/fhir/r4/Patient" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/fhir+json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -d '{
           "resourceType": "Patient",
           "name": [
             {  
               "use": "official",
               "family": "Doe",
               "given": ["John"]
             }
           ]
         }'
```
This command sends a POST request to create a new Patient resource with the specified name.
