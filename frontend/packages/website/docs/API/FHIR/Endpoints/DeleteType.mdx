# Delete Resource Type

The FHIR [conditional delete operation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#3.1.0.7.1) allows you to delete resources of a specific type that match certain search criteria. This is done using an HTTP DELETE request to the endpoint corresponding to the resource type with query parameters.

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI" default>

**Note:** The CLI `delete` command only supports deleting individual resource instances, not conditional deletion by type. For conditional deletion, use the TypeScript client or cURL.

To delete a single Patient resource:

```bash
haste-health api delete-type Patient 12345
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript Client">

Conditionally delete Patient resources using the TypeScript client:

```typescript
import { AsynchronousClient } from '@haste-health/client';
import { R4 } from '@haste-health/fhir-types/versions';

// Assuming you have a configured client
const client: AsynchronousClient<{}> = /* ... */;

await client.delete_type(
  {},
  R4,
  'Patient',
  'identifier=http://example.org/fhir/ids|12345'
);

console.log('Matching Patient resources deleted');
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

Conditionally delete Patient resources using cURL:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.haste.health/w/[tenant]/[project]/api/v1/fhir/r4/Patient?identifier=http://example.org/fhir/ids|12345" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
Replace `[tenant]` with your tenant name and `[project]` with your project ID.
