# Delete Resource Instance

The FHIR [delete operation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#delete) allows you to delete a specific resource instance from the FHIR server. This is done using an HTTP DELETE request to the endpoint corresponding to the resource type and ID.

## Endpoint

```
DELETE /w/[tenant]/api/v1/[project]/fhir/r4/[ResourceType]/[id]
```

Where `[ResourceType]` is the type of resource you want to delete (e.g., Patient, Observation) and `[id]` is the logical ID of the resource instance.

## Response

If the resource is deleted successfully, the server will respond with a `204 No Content` status code with no response body.

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

Alternatively, some servers may respond with `200 OK` and include an `OperationOutcome`:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/fhir+json
```

```json
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "information",
      "code": "informational",
      "diagnostics": "Resource Patient/12345 deleted successfully"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

If the resource is not found or cannot be deleted, the server will respond with an appropriate error status code and include an `OperationOutcome` resource in the response body.

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/fhir+json
```

```json
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": "not-found",
      "diagnostics": "Resource Patient/12345 not found"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example using cURL

Here is an example of how to delete a Patient resource using cURL:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/w/[tenant]/api/v1/[project]/fhir/r4/Patient/12345" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This command sends a DELETE request to remove the Patient resource with ID 12345.
