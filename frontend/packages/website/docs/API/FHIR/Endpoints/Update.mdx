# Update Resource

The FHIR [update operation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#update) allows you to update an existing resource on the FHIR server. This is done using an HTTP PUT request to the endpoint corresponding to the resource type and ID.

## Endpoint

```
PUT /w/[tenant]/api/v1/[project]/fhir/r4/[ResourceType]/[id]
```

Where `[ResourceType]` is the type of resource you want to update (e.g., Patient, Observation) and `[id]` is the logical ID of the resource instance.

## Request Body

The request body should contain the complete JSON representation of the resource with the updated values. Here is an example of updating a Patient resource:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "12345",
  "name": [
    {
      "use": "official",
      "family": "Smith",
      "given": ["John"]
    }
  ],
  "gender": "male",
  "birthDate": "1980-01-01",
  "telecom": [
    {
      "system": "phone",
      "value": "555-1234"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Response

If the resource is updated successfully, the server will respond with a `200 OK` status code and include the updated resource in the response body.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/fhir+json
```

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "12345",
  "meta": {
    "versionId": "2",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-11-26T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "name": [
    {
      "use": "official",
      "family": "Smith",
      "given": ["John"]
    }
  ],
  "gender": "male",
  "birthDate": "1980-01-01",
  "telecom": [
    {
      "system": "phone",
      "value": "555-1234"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

If there are any issues with the request (e.g., resource not found, invalid data), the server will respond with an appropriate error status code and include an `OperationOutcome` resource in the response body.

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/fhir+json
```

```json
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": "invalid",
      "diagnostics": "Invalid phone number format"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example using cURL

Here is an example of how to update a Patient resource using cURL:

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3000/w/[tenant]/api/v1/[project]/fhir/r4/Patient/12345" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/fhir+json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -d '{
           "resourceType": "Patient",
           "id": "12345",
           "name": [
             {
               "use": "official",
               "family": "Smith",
               "given": ["John"]
             }
           ],
           "gender": "male",
           "birthDate": "1980-01-01"
         }'
```

This command sends a PUT request to update the Patient resource with ID 12345.
