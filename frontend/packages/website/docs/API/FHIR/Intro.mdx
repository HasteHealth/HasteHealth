# Introduction to FHIR

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard developed by HL7 for exchanging healthcare information electronically. 
It is designed to facilitate interoperability between different healthcare systems, enabling seamless sharing of clinical data across various platforms and applications.

FHIR is relevant in today's healthcare landscape as it addresses the growing need for efficient data exchange, improved patient care, and enhanced clinical decision-making. 
By adopting FHIR, healthcare providers can ensure that their systems can communicate effectively, leading to better coordination of care and improved health outcomes.

Haste Health leverages FHIR to provide a robust and flexible platform for healthcare data management. Our platform supports FHIR R4, 
allowing healthcare organizations to integrate their systems seamlessly and access patient data in real-time. 
This enables providers to deliver more personalized care, streamline workflows, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
