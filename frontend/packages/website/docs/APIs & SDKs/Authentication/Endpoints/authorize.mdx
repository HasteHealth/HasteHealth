# Authorization Endpoint

The [OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationEndpoint) is used to initiate the authentication and authorization flow. This endpoint redirects the user to authenticate and consent to the requested permissions.

## Endpoint

```
GET /oauth2/authorize
```

This endpoint initiates the OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect authorization flow.

## Query Parameters

Required parameters:

- `response_type` - The OAuth 2.0 response type. Use `code` for authorization code flow
- `client_id` - The client identifier issued during registration
- `redirect_uri` - The URI to redirect to after authorization (must be pre-registered)
- `scope` - Space-delimited list of scopes (e.g., `openid profile email`)
- `state` - An opaque value used to maintain state between request and callback (recommended for security)
- `code_challenge` - PKCE code challenge (for public clients)
- `code_challenge_method` - PKCE code challenge method (`S256` or `plain`)

We require the use of PKCE for all clients.

## Response

If the user successfully authenticates and authorizes, the server will redirect to the `redirect_uri` with an authorization code:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://example.com/callback?code=AUTH_CODE_HERE&state=abc123
```

The redirect includes:
- `code` - The authorization code (short-lived, single-use)
- `state` - The state parameter from the request (for validation)

## Error Handling

If there is an error, the server will redirect to the `redirect_uri` with error parameters:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://example.com/callback?error=access_denied&error_description=The+user+denied+the+request&state=abc123
```

Common error codes:

- `invalid_request` - The request is missing a required parameter or is otherwise malformed
- `unauthorized_client` - The client is not authorized to request an authorization code
- `access_denied` - The user or authorization server denied the request
- `unsupported_response_type` - The authorization server does not support this response type
- `invalid_scope` - The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed
- `server_error` - The authorization server encountered an unexpected error
- `temporarily_unavailable` - The authorization server is temporarily unavailable

After receiving the authorization code, exchange it for tokens at the token endpoint using the `code_verifier`.
