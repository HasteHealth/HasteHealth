# Intro

Welcome to the Haste Health documentation! This guide will help you get started with setting up and using Haste Health.

## What is Haste Health?
Haste Health is a fast open-source healthcare developer platform designed to facilitate healthcare data interoperability using the FHIR (
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. It provides tools and services to manage, store, and exchange healthcare information efficiently.


## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (Docker Engine version 27 or later)

## Running Haste Health with Docker
This will setup all the infrastructure required to run Haste Health and start the main server and worker.

The server will be available at http://api.haste.health

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HasteHealth/HasteHealth/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

Write out a detailed site guide and link to other documentation pages as needed.
